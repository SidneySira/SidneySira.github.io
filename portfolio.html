        <p>Anime Clicker is a challenging game that consists of clicking also created by Nate Trichanhle and myself. For every click on the icon you will get points for it, but here's where the randomness occurs for every click you'll recieve from 7-10 points.
        The game gets harder by going onto the next level, you get more time but the number of clicks are challenging to accomplish. The game ends when you win all the levels, and you lose when you cant't achieve the number
        of points asked for, and the points and time resets.</p>

        <p>The inspiration behind Anime Clicker is Cookie Clicker. a very addicting tapping game on mobile devices. Two successful points in our game was our point system and reset system. Two obstacles in 
        our game was the time resetting it would not go 15 all the time, and as well as our "more block" reset button it wouldn't reset to the home page. If I had more time I would try to make the game more smoother and more appealing to the eye.
        An algorithm that contributes significantly to the game is our home page when the flag is clicked the points and timer is hidden until "play" icon is clicked, it shows.</p>
